    "# COMP24112 Summative Exercise: Air Quality Analysis (30 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab exercise is about air quality analysis, where you will predict air quality through solving classification and regression tasks. You will submit a notebook file, a pdf report, and a trained model. You will be marked for implementation, design, result and analysis. Your code should be easy to read and your report should be concise (max 600 words). It is strongly recommended that you use a LaTeX editor, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), to write your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note your notebook should take no more than 10 minutes to run on lab computers. **There is 1 mark for code efficiency.**"

    "The provided dataset contains measurements of air quality from a multisensor device. The device used spectrometer analyzers (variables marked by \"GT\") and solid state metal oxide detectors (variables marked by \"PT08.Sx\"), as well as temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and absolute humidity (AH) sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 3304 instances of hourly averaged measurements taken at road level in a polluted city. You will predict the CO(GT) variable representing carbon monoxide levels. There are missing features in this dataset, flagged by the number `-999`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to pre-process the dataset to handle missing features, for which please self-learn from scikit-learn on how to [impute missing values](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html). You will need to split the dataset into training and testing sets, also to run cross validation, when you see fit. For this, please self-learn from scikit-learn on [data splitting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) and [cross validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html).
